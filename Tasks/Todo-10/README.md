## Abstract
Dimensionality reduction is a key step in simplifying high-dimensional datasets for analysis, visualization, and computational efficiency. This repository explores various linear and nonlinear dimensionality reduction techniques, including **PCA**, **Kernel PCA**, **t-SNE**, **UMAP**, **ISOMAP**, and more. 

These techniques are applied across different scenarios, such as tabular data, image datasets, and large-scale environments like Databricks. The repository also includes interactive examples for hands-on learning and visualization.
